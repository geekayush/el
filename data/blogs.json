      "text": "<h4>What Are Event Sponsors?</h4><p>An event sponsor is a company that supports an event, usually by providing funds, in exchange for something valuable. Oftentimes this <em>\"something valuable\"</em> comes in the form of increased brand exposure, access to attendee data, speaking opportunities at the event, or discounted event tickets. Companies sponsor events that benefit them in some way and a partnership is forged when both the event planners and the organization see such value in an event that furthers their reach among a wider range of potential audience while improving the overall standard of the event. </p><h4>Why Is It Important To Have Event Sponsors?</h4><p>Running an event is an expensive endeavour. Rarely are ticket sales alone enough to break even—at least not while keeping ticket prices affordable. What’s an event planner to do? Secure event sponsorships. Securing event sponsorship helps in planning a financially viable event and keep ticket prices down, ensuring more attendees will be able to come. And with the recent shift to virtual, almost 80% of organizers are offering free registration to their attendees, which lowers the barrier of entry and thus, means greater reach for event planners. </p><p>A good sponsor also lends credibility to an event and creates trust in the people attending it. Just bring in a big sponsor and see your event skyrocket in popularity. Be honest—all things being equal, would you rather attend an event with no sponsors or one that’s sponsored by Amazon? Most of us would rather attend the event sponsored by Amazon, even if both events were being put on by the same company, were on the same topic, and had the same speakers. Why? Because Amazon is one of the biggest companies in the world and if they decide to sponsor an event, then it must be good.While partnering with a company like Amazon may be a stretch, securing known and respected brands in your organization’s field to sponsor your event will lend instant credibility and likely increase registration numbers.</p><p>Lastly, sponsors may be able to provide your event with other resources and perks beyond just money and credibility. For example, perhaps your event partners with a local restaurant. In exchange for promoting their business to all of your attendees, they’ll allow you to use their event space and will provide catered lunches.</p><p>Another perk that sponsoring companies can provide is increased exposure for your event. Let’s say a customer of a sponsoring company is browsing that particular sponsor’s social media feed and sees that they’ve partnered with you. The customer may decide to attend your event because they trust the sponsoring company.</p><h4>How To Identify The Right Sponsor For An Event?</h4><p>Now that we know how important is an event sponsor for organizing a commercially viable as well as an aesthetically appealing event, finding the right event sponsors is crucial for the execution of a successful event. For example, McDonalds sponsoring an event about healthy lifestyle and the likes is a NO-NO. Rather than spamming every business you find and presenting them with event sponsorship proposals, first identify the kinds of companies that would be a good fit. Then reach out and interact with only those brands. Contacting organizations that don’t align with your event brand, or don’t have a history of sponsoring events isn’t productive. Taking the time to find the right partners will also save you time and increase your success rate.</p><h4>How To Pitch Your Event To A Potential Investor?</h4><p>After considerable research has been done about the potential sponsors of the event in question and the target demographic of the audience attending the event, it is now time to meet these potential sponsors and pitch your plans for a sponsorship deal.</p><p>While pitching your event, keep the value the event will provide in centre. No organization will support your event out of the goodness in its heart. There needs to be an equal exchange of value and you need to communicate this value in your pitch. To do this, make your pitch about the company you’re contacting, not your event and focus on how it benefits them. Include information like how many attendees you expect to have, your audience demographics, brands that have sponsored your event in the past and any other piece of important information that you think might help your potential sponsor become interested in sponsoring your event. Proving value is difficult enough for live events, but it’s even more challenging virtually. Call out the value sponsors will see if they partner with your event and focus on the benefits of a virtual event.</p><p>Social proof in the form of testimonials from previous partners can go a long way towards convincing a brand to sponsor your event. Just like we all read product reviews before making online purchases, potential sponsors will want to know if previous partners had a good experience with your brand and found sponsorship to be a worthwhile investment.</p><p>The key to both pitching and partnering with sponsors boils down to communication. As you begin to work with sponsors, it’s important to have a common language. This allows you to align on key business goals and outcomes that make both parties successful. Using private conversations on digital platforms or virtual meetings can create seamless communication between both the event marketers and the sponsors. Both parties can communicate and agree upon opportunities that benefit them mutually in some way.</p><h4>How To Secure a Deal With A Sponsor?</h4><p>There are certain factors that determine whether you get that deal finalised by the sponsor of choice.</p><ol><li><p>Creating a tier list of all the perks a sponsor can avail from their involvement in the event and then selling it as different sponsoring packages each with different perks for the sponsor can really up your game when pitching your event to a potential sponsor. This will likely have the sponsor give you the funding and/or other resources you need to get the event going. For example-<ol type=\"a\"><li><p>The Bronze Package:- Your company logo on all event marketing materials, a guaranteed digital sponsor page, a virtual sponsorship gift, sponsor placement in lower thirds, 30-second promo video before keynote session.</p></li><li><p>The Silver Package:- Everything in the Bronze Package + branded transitions between videos and/or sessions. (Only 25 available.)</p></li><li><p>The Gold Package:- Everything in the Bronze and Silver Packages + a branded lounge area for the VIP clients and exclusive networking privileges with these VIP guests.</p><p>The more money an organization pays, the more benefits they receive. You can also create different packages for companies as opposed to individuals, give discounts when multiple tickets are purchased at once, and more.</p></li></ol><li><p>As stated earlier, the pitch of your event to your potential sponsor must communicate the value they will receive from sponsoring the event. And what better way to do so by creating exclusivity for the sponsor to showcase their brand. There are many different ways to add value to your sponsorship packages. A few sponsorship ideas include guaranteeing a speaking slot for the CEO of a sponsoring company, allowing partners to put their company names on breakout rooms, and including a sponsor’s logo on the merchandise given to each attendee as mementos. Everybody knows <em>\"Exclusivity Sells\"</em> and these exclusive opportunities can really make sponsors spring up and loosen their pockets to give you that big budget you were hoping for. This is because First, it’s a simple mathematics equation. There’s only so much time in the day and resources on hand. If you were to let more companies participate, the value of the package would go down. Second, exclusivity breeds desire. As humans, we always want what we can’t have. And we tend to feel better about ourselves when we have what others want but can’t get. Making your top sponsorship packages exclusive will increase the chances of people wanting to buy them.</p></li><li><p>Your event sponsorship packages will only sell if potential sponsors understand exactly what they will receive once they make a purchase. They’ll also need to know how to become eligible for each package. Clarity is absolutely your friend here. Spell out every package benefit, perk, and requirement in crystal clear language. Potential sponsors should never have to guess at what they’ll receive in exchange for a portion of their company’s budget. This is especially true when selling sponsorships for large sums of money.</p></li><li><p>Virtual and hybrid events rely more on technology than in-person events did previously. Over 50% of organizers believe event technology tools will play a key role in connecting sponsors and attendees both virtually and in-person. So it’s important to find a platform that allows you to create a great website to attract sponsors.</p></li></ol><h4>Providing ROI To the Sponsor</h4><p>The most important thing here is that the potential sponsor of an event might want to see the profitability that other sponsors received from sponsoring your events. You can show the data of the number of attendees in the event and their testimonials from the post event surveys, the networking and marketing opportunities other sponsors have received from sponsoring your events. When a potential gets a hold of such data that indicates that sponsoring your event can bring them manifold returns, they can easily give you the amount you were hoping for. Also, sponsors like to see their profits go up from their association to another brand so if you can get hold of such figures then don’t leave any stone unturned to get these figures.</p><p>So now that you know everything about Sponsorships, a quick heads up for you the reader, We are an Event Organizer Company, ready and capable to handle all your needs for any event; from wedding parties and receptions to corporate events and moving for social awareness causes to trade exhibitions; we have you covered from every angle.

      "text": "<p>There’s no denying that the past year has been hard for event creators. With venues closed, restrictions constantly changing, and new safety regulations to get your head around, it can be hard to stay motivated. While it’s normal for your energy and enthusiasm to ebb, losing your mojo needn’t mean losing everything you’ve worked for.</p><p>These tips on getting through tough times will help you cope with complications, boost your motivation, and reaffirm your commitment to the cause.</p><h4>1. Remember your mission:-</h4><p>Remember why you’re doing what you’re doing. What were your goals when you started? What have you achieved so far? Who would you be letting down if you gave up?</p><p>If you’re not sure, it can be helpful to sit down for a goal-setting session. Write down your ambitions, successes, and key motivating factors to remind yourself daily what you’re working towards. This way, you’ll be able to get through small tasks by focusing on how they help to advance your overall mission.</p><h4>2. Visualise a successful outcome:-</h4><p>Visualisation is a technique used by professional athletes, actors, and musicians. By picturing themselves succeeding before performing, they’re able to greatly increase their chances of actually experiencing success.</p><p>This technique can be applied to any aspect of life. Whatever it is that you want to achieve, simply imagine it happening. The more detailed the visualisation, the better – from the conversations you have and the words you speak, right down to the clothes you’re wearing and the weather.</p><p>When you think of a big goal, it can be all too easy to focus on the obstacles in your way, especially when having to deal with tough times. This is actually negative visualisation and only acts to stand between you and your dreams. If you want to be victorious, think victorious.</p><h4>3. Take a break and treat yourself:-</h4><p>You’ve heard the old saying: “A change is as good as a rest.” Well, it’s also true that a rest can be as good as a change. Sometimes we just need a bit of space to get our groove back.</p><p>If you can, take a holiday, even if it’s just a “staycation.” Enjoy some rest and recuperation on the sofa, try a new activity, or head out for long walks in nature. A week away from your desk can work wonders for boosting flagging motivation and reigniting your creativity.</p><p>If you can’t step back for a week, make your weekends work for you by seeking a little tranquillity and indulgence. Put your phone on “do not disturb” mode and focus on self-care, whether that’s having an at-home spa day or spending time on your hobbies.</p><h4>4. Break down big and scary challenges:-</h4><p>You can make big challenges less intimidating by breaking them down into component parts. By setting small, more easily achievable goals, you’ll achieve the satisfaction of regularly realising them.</p><p>This feeling of success is a wonderful motivator. And if you keep accomplishing small goals, before you know it, you’ll be halfway to fulfilling a big one.</p><h4>5. Celebrate each small victory:-</h4><p>When you’re working towards a big goal, it can be easy to lose sight of the little successes. But just because you’re focused on signing up 20 new attendees to your online workshop, it doesn’t mean you shouldn’t celebrate each one you secure.</p><p>Treating yourself every time you hit a milestone is one of the best strategies to motivate yourself. You don’t need to pop a bottle of champagne every time, but you should treat yourself to something small like a bar of chocolate.</p><h4>6. Share your challenges and ask for support:-</h4><p>If you feel out of your depth, don’t be afraid to turn to others for help. Perhaps you have an old boss or other business mentor who’s been through similar challenges and can share their experiences and knowledge.</p><p>Alternatively, try the power of collective problem-solving by discussing the challenges with your team. You don’t have to go it alone, even if you’re the boss. You can also ask your community for support. Even if you’re not running events at the moment, past attendees may be able to help out by offering feedback.</p><h4>7. Get inspired with your favourite movies, books, and songs:-</h4><p>We spoke earlier about the importance of taking a break once in a while and refocusing yourself. Getting lost in a great movie or book is a really effective way to do this. Choose one with an inspirational message – the feel-good ending will leave you on a high, feeling ready to slay your own dragons.</p><p>If you need a quick fix, simply stick on your favourite song and sing along. Belting out life-affirming lyrics can work wonders when times are tough.</p><h4>8. Promise yourself a big reward once you reach your final goal:-</h4><p>All big companies understand the power of incentives. Promising their executives a money-can’t-buy experience in recognition of great work is a tried and trusted motivational technique. It works for self-motivation, too.</p><p>What would encourage you to keep going? Devise and plan your perfect reward and display a reminder on your desk. Don’t forget to visualise yourself enjoying it and you’re bound to make it happen.</p><h4>9. Get physical with some exercise:-</h4><p>When you have no motivation, strap on your trainers. Heading out for a jog or participating in a fitness event can boost your endorphin levels – helping you out of your low mood.</p><p>Studies have shown that exercising regularly can help to reduce stress and boost self-esteem. Over time, it’ll also raise your endurance levels, so you’ll have more energy to think clearly and come up with exciting new ideas.</p><h4>10. Stick to a routine to beat procrastination:- </h4><p>Even if you don’t usually enjoy having a strict schedule, building a routine can help you to regain your enthusiasm and feel more in control. Setting yourself soft deadlines throughout the day also makes it more likely that you’ll get the job done.</p><p>Sit down and create a schedule that you think you can stick to. If you’re not an early riser, don’t force yourself to get up at 7 a.m. – set yourself up for success instead. Remember to add breaks, and give yourself things to look forward to in the evening so you have a reward for finishing on time.</p><p>If procrastination is a big issue for you, try scheduling the tasks you dislike the most in the first hour of the day. This strategy is known as “eating the frog,” after a famous quote by Mark Twain: “If it’s your job to eat a frog, it’s best to do it first thing in the morning. And if it’s your job to eat two frogs, it’s best to eat the biggest one first.” Getting things out of the way early will take weight off your shoulders, so you can enjoy your day without having the “frog” at the back of your mind.</p><p>Getting through tough times all year round</p><p>No matter what the day brings, don’t forget that each new morning offers a new opportunity to get it right. Pandemic or not, difficult times are just a fact of life. There will be moments in the future when you feel yourself struggling while organising events, so remember to use these motivation tips to get back on top. Try your best to work towards your goals each and every day, celebrate the small successes, and the big achievements will surely follow.</p><p>It’s time to get motivated – connect with others who are in the same boat.</p>"

      "text": "<p>Every year Event planners make the list of the most stressful jobs. In 2020, we were the third-highest ranked job that deals with stress, after surgeons and police officers – crazy! Stress is something Event Planners face almost every day. Whether it’s the stress of something going wrong like the weather or the stress of having too much to do, there are ways to handle stress, as you’ll find below:</p><p>If you are right in the middle of an event, step away for a moment and just take a few breaths and count to 10, which will help you get refocused and energized!</p><p>A second way to cope with stress is to exercise when you get a chance. Exercising releases endorphins which make you happier! It’s shown that people who get enough sleep and exercise have higher endorphins. Exercising will also help you when you have been on your feet for twelve hours and are exhausted – imagine being out of shape and doing that! Our job is stressful enough.</p><p>A third way to help combat stress is to have lavender oil nearby. Just by having the scent of lavender oil around can help (bonus – it’s great for your Emergency Kit to prevent fainting). If you have an inclination that someone may faint, spray some lavender oil on their bouquet.</p><p>Another way is to cut back on coffee. If you are constantly drinking coffee, studies show caffeine and coffee can make people anxious so opt for water instead!</p><p>Another way to combat stress is by keeping a journal. If you are stressed, just write down the reasons and how you can solve the problems. Having different options can help you make a better decision. If you have a gratitude journal, stop and take a moment to read one of the things you are grateful for. This will help you recognize why you are doing event planning – to make people happy!</p><p>My last tip for de-stressing in a moment’s time is chewing gum. This simple act sends brain waves that help you relax and calm down. Studies show the harder you chew the gum, the less stressed you will be.</p><p>While all these will help you combat stress learning how to say no to clients and not procrastinating are also great tips as well. Never be afraid to tell a client no! Sometimes their visions are literally impossible. Don’t be afraid to stand your ground.</p>"

      "text": "<p>Events bring people together. They educate, empower and inspire audiences. They also spark social movements. They can raise profits and build brand awareness. But the current pandemic of COVID 19 has caused a drastic change in the way we interact with others, live our lives and cope with challenges in changing scenarios of the present times. The same impact has been seen on the way we organize, conduct and attend everts. But is often said that out of a crisis comes opportunity for transformation.</p><p>The events industry has changed tremendously since the lockdown and will continue to change and adapt as per the current scenario. The way events are organized has changed to a large degree since the lockdown and with the looming threat of a Third Wave, it is imperative that new measures have to be adopted on how events can be organized so as to reach the same amount of audience without compromising with their safety and health while creating memorable experiences for all who attend and organize these events.</p><p>Since the Lockdown, a lot of companies have found refuge in the Digital world to create and spread brand awareness about themselves or their clients through social media promotions. Even all the artists, big or small have taken up the social media way to connect to their fan base on a wider scale as apposed to physical concerts and meetups. Virtual events can sometimes create a very impactful experience for those attending the event while reducing organizing costs and the attendees can enjoy from the comfort of their homes.</p><p>Although, virtual events have many advantages and can easily engage more people on a larger scale very efficiently, going back to the good old days of physical events will be tough in many aspects. Firstly, because of the ongoing pandemic, it can be problematic to attract the same number of people to attend a physical live event because of the fact that people have now adjusted themselves to the hobbit of attending all manner of events digitally and might also fear that they may contract illness from the virus if they attended any mass gathering.</p><p>Social distancing and hygiene will become a key factor when organizing any event. Access to live events will be tighter, requests may be made regarding the health and travel information of staff and participants. A system may be put into place to assess risk. With the outcome is yet to be known on immunity passports, proof of vaccine certificates or testing on-site, this is a sensitive area that will need to be regulated closely. The number of people attending such events will be limited, either by the Government mandate or arbitrarily by the organizers whilst a small and barebones crew of only the most necessary people will organize the events keeping view of the guidelines of physical distancing and crowd management. Say Goodbye to buffet systems at wedding receptions and large crowds of people doing casual networking in huge corporate exhibitions and say Hello to ready to eat lunch packs and networking on websites like LinkedIn. At the same time, hybrid events are seeing a rise in popularity and preference where a small number of people actually attend events physically while it is broadcasted for a wider audience online. Availability of hand sanitizing stations as well as segregating entry and exit points will also be a key factor while handling crowd management.</p><p>Although physically meeting clients and new prospective partners and suppliers will resume but the digital approach will still be preferred and people will prefer contactless check ins and payments with digital audio tours of exhibition grounds.</p><p>Travel and, therefore, international events might still be a long ways away because there is no universal vaccine nor is there any globally accepted international travel guideline even now or for POST COVID 19.</p><p>Now is the time to reorganise and restructure all that we know – to reassess our values and priorities and to remodel our approaches towards producing and attending events because the times are changing and so should we. It is said that out of a crisis comes opportunity for transformation.</p>"

      "text": "<p>Everywhere you go people are always talking about the need for teamwork. Whether it is at the home, office, sports event being a team is always said to be the key to achieving success in whatever you’re doing. One famous quote says “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together”. But, what is a team and why is teamwork so important?</p> <p>You might have the most talented group of people working together – but there’s one vital ingredient that you still need to succeed.</p> <p>Teamwork:-</p> <p>Teamwork is about more than simply being able to share a task with each other, bounce ideas or work in the same space. Effective teamwork not only helps your organisation go further and be more productive – it can also help each person on the team to exceed their own potential – and discover how far they can really go.</p> <p>It improves efficiency and productivity One of the greatest advantages of working together as a good team is that it can make life so much easier!</p> <p>By making sure that everyone is cooperating together and communicating effectively, you can really help to make sure the workload is shared between everyone. If any issues arise at any time – they can be identified and tackled promptly. This can make sure you avoid getting bogged down in any difficulties or problems – and work together to resolve them as soon as possible.</p> <p>A great way to work on this is by looking at how you approach a challenge as a team. Teambuilding exercises, such as completing a puzzle or treasure hunt with lots of clues are brilliant to develop these!</p><p>It brings a diverse range of views to the melting pot Another brilliant advantage of working with a group of people is the sheer diversity of ideas you get to experience.</p> <p>It’s great to have a wide variety of inspirations, ideas and approaches to problem-solving. Group brainstorming activities are a fantastic way of tackling a challenge together – as you can inspire each other to come up with potential solutions, discuss any obstacles that might arise, and reach an agreed decision as a group.</p> <p>Encourage every member of your team to share their views and ideas. While brainstorming activities are great, you can also try different ways to do this. Why not have a simple suggestion box where people can put in their thoughts? Or try silent brainstorming – a clever technique that makes sure everyone has a voice and gets heard.</p><p>It boosts trust and synergy in the workplace. Teamwork isn’t always just about the team as a whole, or the organisation you’re a part of.</p><p>Each person on the team matters – and they have their own individual talents, strengths and challenges.</p><p>Working as a team helps you build closer bonds with each other – as you learn how each person helps to contribute to your overall success, you can also begin to appreciate their value and aspirations as individuals too.</p><p>Help your team build closer ties by encouraging them to enjoy a regular night out or meal together – without any of the expectations of the workplace, it can be a great opportunity to get to know one another better, and foster greater trust.</p>"

Also they are a lot less personal as the networking with people is just the same as doing it in person. </p> <p>If the platform used for an event is intuitive, it can cause trouble because the audience won’t want to spend too much time figuring out how to use the platform. </p> <p>The hardest part in organising virtual events is to attract people as the event should look like some great cumshaw to attract the audience. It’s almost very easy for people to walk away from these events because if any of the speaker babble for about 50-60 seconds – and you will see the participants leaving the event. The lack of interaction can kill even the most exciting subject, & thus potentially a whole event. To make it more engaging, we can have Q&A sessions, quick polls or let them share their own ideas. </p>"

They are a great way for people to search for topics on social networks that have a common theme. </p> <p>When used properly, they are an integral part of digital marketing. They can help campaign to go viral & take its own life beyond your current user base. You can follow specific hashtags to stay updated on a current topic/trend, you can create your own hashtag to promote a new product or service. </p> <p>Hashtags are very simple and effective. It’s easily create & searchable, & has become an extraordinary marketing tool for businesses, organisations, celebrities & even the average individual.</p> <p>We, at Eventlope have our own hashtag which is #letschangetheuptrendtogether by working on which we intend to change the trend of events in Uttar Pradesh. As the people of UP don’t give too much importance to events, therefore, we intend to change their mentality towards it & bring the trend of Delhi- Mumbai here in Lucknow. </p> <p>What happens in the metro cities: Events are organised every weekend & people in these cities search for them & take part in these events. So we are working with our young and dynamic team to bring the same trend in Lucknow. We are planning to organize the biggest concert in Lucknow which will help in taking our motive forward. </p> <p>We have another hashtag which is #letschangethetrendtogether by which we want to change the trend to events in India & we are planning to bring the events which are organised abroad here in India.</p>"

      "text": "<p> As the months have passed, social distancing and stay-at-home orders have grown stale to the point of feeling unbearable at times. Boredom set in weeks ago and the process of adjusting to the new normal seems like an ongoing process that many of us are still trying to master. Returning to work for many people is bittersweet because although we can (finally) leave our homes and return to some semblance of a routine, the vision of masks, gloves, repeated sanitizing, and six-feet apart warnings reminds us that life definitely does not look or feel the same.</p> <p>Missing Out - The gradual opening of nonessential services and businesses is considered a step forward for many people while others worry about the potential of setbacks and health consequences. As society cautiously tests the waters, there are still many events and activities that are on hold indefinitely. Most celebratory activities, holiday events, and large social gatherings that we once enjoyed and never believed could threaten public health, are among those that experts anticipate will be forbidden for at least the remainder of this year or longer. Many of us have already missed out on celebrating milestones in the way we are accustomed to and as the months go by, these missed milestones will likely touch all of our lives eventually. </p> <p>Realizing New Gains - As we process the changes to our everyday life, it’s important to also consider the many experiences, values, and growth opportunities we have gained. Alongside the missed milestones are so many lessons and insights that we’ve developed during the pandemic. Ask anyone, even those who seem to struggle the most with adapting to these changes, and they will tell you something highly valuable that they’ve learned throughout these past few months—their own, personal eye-opening experiences. </p> <p>Below we will review a few common experiences and events that have been taken from our everyday lives only to be replaced with many other strengths, attributes, and sources of gratitude. </p> <p>Missed Milestone/ New Experiences</p> <p>→Gained Insights, Realizations, & Experiences - Graduations at all stages, grades, and levels</p> <p>→A lesser focus on the symbolism of the celebration and a greater realization of the hard work involved and finding satisfaction in being proud of oneself for the accomplishment. - Birthday celebrations in large groups</p> <p>→Appreciation of close loved ones and more alone time to reflect on a new year, new goals, and new hopes for the future. - Public leisure/entertainment activities (e.g., restaurants, malls, movie theatres, bars) </p> <p>→Realizing how much focus we place on material things, how much money we spend on unnecessary items/activities, and how none of these things are important next to the health of ourselves and our loved ones. – Boredom</p> <p>→Discovering new ways to stay busy and getting involved in new hobbies and activities. Realizing how much we depend on the constant stimulation of going out and 'doing something'. - Staying at home, too long and too often. </p> <p>→Appreciating home life, family life, and realizing how much time we spend at work while missing out on spending time with our spouse/partner and/or children.- News updates on fatalities. </p> <p>→Gratitude for our health, increased awareness of not only personal safety, but our social duty to do what we can to maintain the safety of others, especially vulnerable populations. </p> <p>Realizing Even More</p> <p>There are so many eye-opening experiences that have resulted from the pandemic, staying at home, and being unable to gather socially. For all the moments and experiences we have missed out on, we have found that we have gained so much more. The virus has, in a sense, brought healing to so many of us through our increased gratitude, appreciation, and renewed sense of meaning in our lives. Continue this exercise by listing the things in your life that have come to a pause or may be aspects of your life that you have lost entirely and may never get back and then think of the many parts of yourself and your life that have grown and developed from your loss. </p>"

      "text": "<p>While people believe that virtual events will become the new normal, will a video interface ever be able to deliver the experience of face-to-face interactions? Most importantly, will the purpose of networking and brand visibility be fulfilled by these virtual events? It’s a hard thing to conclude; currently, most organizers are tied by their situations to resort to virtual, but some events work best with in-person participation, like sports and concerts. </p><p>This, for sure, has given rise to a new buzzword in the events community, which is 'Hybrid'. As the term denotes, it’s a mix of virtual and in-person events—a webcast of an event that’s happening live somewhere. That sounds cool, right? It will surely increase the accessibility of the events and make it possible to attend virtually for those who cannot travel. But will all this lead to everyone appreciating the value of face-to-face events more than ever? Only time will tell. </p> <p>For now, we know there are tough times ahead, and we are confident that the incredibly resilient event industry will make it through them. We’ll work hard and smart and—most importantly—together to overcome the challenges ahead of us. If we do this, we’ll get back to the good times (or maybe better times) soon. </p><p>We hope that you are healthy and in good spirits. Stay safe. Stay strong. Stay positive!</p>"
